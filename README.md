# planetsGame
A little simulation created with PyGame.

## TODO:
  - Center largest planets efficienty (using "camera angle" instead of selectional gravity)
    - OR Create a Central planet type that's fixed to the center applying Double force to other planet since it cannot move.
  - Fix GhostPlanets that sometimes effect real planets
  - Create Planets that "glue" to each other (maybe different simulation)
    - Different glue methods (stick and form)
  - Create Translucent trail for planets.
  - Create visual effects for each different type of planet.
  - Make space look cooler (blue and wavey)
  - Create visual effects for each planet (Unstable planet with RGB)
  - Upload to personal website (when created)
